- bio: 'Ducky is an enthusiastic and often smiley person. An interest in everything
    and a passion for augmented reality, games, and having a positive impact fuels
    their bounciness. Originally from Tasmania, Ducky accidentally moved to the
    other side of the world in 2017. This hasn''t changed much, except added an additional
    language to learn, and extra joy for visiting Australia, especially to see the
    pyconau community. '

When thinking about where to start with python and games, the first thing that might come to mind is pygame. However, python has been used in many well known commercial games titles and can be used in many different ways throughout the game development process. This talk will examine a range of game titles, genres and platforms, from AAA to Indie, to show how python is being used in each; discussing the strength and weaknesses of using python, how it has been done, and how it might be in the future.  

This won't give a direct answer on how to build a game in python, but should cover useful information and examples of how python is already used for planning, building, extending, and maintaining games.
