Even if you consider yourself not a designer, you'll still be placed in situations where you have to do some design. A personal website, a landing page for your open-source project, slides for a presentation at work... 

This presentation is geared towards design beginners, defining the stepping stones you need to understand the basics of visual and user experience design, and shortcuts you can use to give yourself a boost and get your designs made more quickly.
