Ready, set, write!

Our PyCon AU 2018 Call for Presentations (CFP) is open from Monday, April 23 [Anywhere On Earth (AoE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth) to Monday, May 28 AoE.

We welcome submissions from everybody, including those:
* who have never given a conference talk before.
* who are new to Python language.
* who have built interesting things in Python,
* who have broken interesting things with Python,
* who have helped build Python, and
* who have expertise to share with our community from fields outside of Python (and outside of technology).

If you've never presented at a conference before and think you might like to try it, we want to hear from you! The program committee is very much interested in encouraging and supporting  to new speakers, and we will have speakers mentors on hand to work with you to develop your proposal and talk content so you can give the best talk possible.

Our CFP process also en compasses submissions to the four Specialist Tracks (Education, Internet of Things, Security and Privacy, and DjangoCon Australia), so you can submit your talk to the main conference and the Specialist Tracks with one click.
